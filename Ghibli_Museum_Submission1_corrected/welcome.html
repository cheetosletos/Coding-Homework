        <p>
          When you walk along Kichijoji Avenue, in the shade of the tall green trees of Mitaka's Inokashira Park, you come upon a colorful building. Standing in front of a sign that says "Ghibli Museum, Mitaka", a very large Totoro welcomes you at the entrance. When you look through the portholes, soot-black Dust Bunnies are there as well. But this is not the real entrance. 
        </p>

          Totoro shows you where the real entrance is. Open the door and welcome to wonderland! Every window and lamp is lovingly hand-crafted with beautiful and colorful stained glass using Ghibli characters, pretty plants and flowers, and forest animals. When the sun is shining, the vivid colors of the glass are reflected in splashes of colored light on the stone floors.

          Look up at the ceiling, and you will find it covered in fresco painting. In the center of a blue sky, there is a shining, smiling sun. Trees stretching up towards the sky are filled with grapes, melons, deliciously ripe fruits, and beautiful blossoms which you may never have seen before. If you look carefully, you may see Kiki on her broom, Nausicaa on her jet glider, or other characters flying through the sky.

Since the Ghibli Museum treats every child as an independent guest, even very small children can stand on the special platform at the reception counter to be handed their own ticket.

                <h3>A Gift from Grampa</h3>

        <p>
          This is one of the five rooms on the first floor called "Where a Film is Born". The room seems to belong to someone who was sketching at the desk just a few minutes ago. The room is filled with books and toys. The walls are all covered with illustrations and sketches. Hanging from the ceiling are a model of an airplane and a model of a Pteranodon. It's a place where the owner of the room has stored his favorite things. 
        </p>

        <p>
          This room provides lots of inspiration for what will go on to the blank piece of paper on the desk to become the origin of an actual film. After walking through the five rooms, you will get an idea how an animated film is made. With a little bit of an idea and a flash of inspiration, a film-maker struggles with his work and ultimately completes the film.

Now you can do it. Next to the Cat Bus, a bunch of soot-black Dust Bunnies are waiting for you to play with them. We wanted to make the Cat Bus as big as it is in the film, but because it wouldn't fit in the museum, we ended up downsizing him a little bit.

          The Cat Bus is for elementary school children and under (age 12 and under) only.

          The Cafe serves both cold and hot meals, snacks and desserts. The menu is simple and the variety is limited, but almost everything comes from organic farms, is very fresh and nutritious, and we cook them with loving care and patience. We specially recommend the jumbo fried pork cutlet sandwich and the strawberry short cake. From the deck's menu, there are ultimate hot dogs, ice-cream (milk and seasonal fruit flavors) and soothing roasted barley tea. Experience the changing seasons and enjoy the slow passing of time at the Cafe after your visit to the museum.

  The Cafe serves both cold and hot meals, snacks and desserts. The menu is simple and the variety is limited, but almost everything comes from organic farms, is very fresh and nutritious, and we cook them with loving care and patience. We specially recommend the jumbo fried pork cutlet sandwich and the strawberry short cake. From the deck's menu, there are ultimate hot dogs, ice-cream (milk and seasonal fruit flavors) and soothing roasted barley tea. Experience the changing seasons and enjoy the slow passing of time at the Cafe after your visit to the museum.

  The museum shop "MAMMA AIUTO!" was named after the sky pirates in "Porco Rosso". It means "Mama, help me" in Italian. Here at this shop, you will find your favorite Studio Ghibli character products along with original Museum gift items. At the reading room "TRI HAWKS", you will find picture books and children's books which are recommended reading selected by the Ghibli Museum and its executive director Hayao Miyazaki. This reading room was opened with the wish that it be a place to give children the opportunity to read.

  The two places and their window displays are filled with things that are pretty, unexpected, and completely out of the ordinary. Spend some time to look around... you might discover something special for yourself.
