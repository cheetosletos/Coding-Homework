		<h1>This is the Museum I Want to Make!</h1>

		<p>A museum that is interesting and which relaxes the soul. A museum where much can be discovered. A museum based on a clear and consistent philosophy. A museum where those seeking enjoyment can enjoy, those seeking to ponder can ponder, and those seeking to feel can feel. A museum that makes you feel more enriched when you leave than when you entered!</p>
	</div>	<!-- BANNER 1 -->

	<div class="banner2">
			<h1>To make such a museum, the building must be...</h1>

		<ul>
			<li>Put together as if it were a film</li>
			<li> Not arrogant, magnificent, flamboyant, or suffocating</li>
			<li> Quality space where people can feel at home, especially when it's not crowded</li>
			<li> A building that has a warm feel and touch</li>
			<li> A building where the breeze and sunlight can freely flow through</li>
		</ul>	
	</div> <!-- BANNER 2 -->

	<div class="banner3">
		<h1>The displays will be...</h1>

		<p>Not only for the benefit of people who are already fans of Studio Ghibli. Not a procession of artwork from past Ghibli films as if it were "a museum of the past". A place where visitors can enjoy by just looking, can understand the artists' spirits, and can gain new insights into animation. Original works and pictures will be made to be exhibited at the museum. A project room and an exhibit room will be made, showing movement and life (Original short films will be produced to released in the museum!). Ghibli's past films will be probed for understanding at a deeper level.</p>

	<div class="banner4">
		<h1>The cafe will be... </h1>

		<p>An important place for relaxation and enjoyment, a place that doesn't underestimate the difficulties of running a museum cafe, and a good cafe with a style all its own where running a cafe is taken seriously and done right.</p>
	</div> <!-- BANNER 4 -->

	<div class="banner5">
		<h1>The museum shop will be...</h1>

		<p>Well-prepared and well-presented for the sake of the visitors and running the museum, not a bargain shop that attaches importance only to the amount of sales. A shop that continues to strive to be a better shop. Where original items made only for the museum are found.</p>
	</div> <!-- BANNER 5 -->

		<h1>The museum's relation to the park is... </h1>

		<p>Not just about caring for the plants and surrounding greenery but also planning for how things can improve ten years into the future. Seeking a way of being and running the museum so that the surrounding park will become even lusher and better, which will in turn make the museum better as well!</p>
